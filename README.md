<h2 align="left"> Abstract </h2>

<p align="justify">
Code smells are harmful code structures that adversely affect qual-
ity and maintainability. Refactoring techniques are employed by
developers to eliminate these undesirable structures. Refactoring
improves code comprehensibility and modifiability by addressing
potential issues and enhancing internal quality attributes such as
cohesion, coupling, complexity, inheritance, and size. However,
manual and undisciplined refactoring practices can lead to code
degradation. Unfortunately, concepts, practices, software refactor-
ing tools, and code smells are rarely discussed in undergraduate
computing courses. Software maintenance, a challenging discipline
for undergraduate students in computing, reflects this problem.
Consequently, the software industry often neglects refactoring
practices, resulting in reduced code readability and maintainability.
In this paper, we present an experience report on teaching code
smells refactoring and its impact on internal quality attributes. The
study was conducted in two undergraduate classes as part of a
Software Quality discipline. We investigate the following topics:
(i) difficult code smells to refactor, (ii) commonly used refactoring
techniques for addressing code smells, (iii) the impact of code smells
refactoring on internal quality attributes, (iv) studentsâ€™ perception
of code smells refactoring practices, and (v) challenges encountered
during code smells refactoring. Our findings contribute to the repli-
cation of this practice in other courses seeking to delve into code
smell refactoring, and promote the use of refactoring practices and
code quality evaluation.
